In an age of surveillance capitalism, algorithmic manipulation, privacy erosion, rising techno-fascism, and impending climate disaster, it's easy to fall prey to pessimism and despair: to grimly accept humanity's inevitable slide into the kind of technology-fueled dystopia that cyberpunk authors have tried to warn us against for decades.

In light of so many imminent threats to society, many technologists are starting to question how the tech they build– whether at their day jobs or within their open source communities– is being leveraged or abused to accelerate this global decline.

But in every era of massive technological change, there have been people _just like us_ who faced difficult questions about the broader implications of their work, wrestling with their own crises of conscience about its real-world impact, and striving to find ways to prevent it from causing widespread harm.

This book tells their stories.

_We Just Build Hammers_ applies a lens of sci-fi / speculative fiction to connect contemporary technologists with a lineage of pioneers and leaders in responsible tech. Its stories span a century of major technological upheavals: from the advent of the atomic age, to the formative years of computing; from the open source visionaries of the turn of the century, to the tech justice revolutionaries of today.

Through the power of storytelling, readers will come to recognize the danger of the comforting myth that technology is neutral; understand their outsized responsibility that comes with their outsized impact on the world; learn to navigate the ethical complexities of their own work; and be inspired to build toward equitable, alternate futures.

This book challenges technologists to consider for themselves whether they're really just building hammers– tools whose potential for good outweighs their potential for harm– or if they are unwittingly contributing to systems that exacerbate inequality, inequity, and injustice.
